- Application to save songs in local storage for data persistence, used for React router Dom routes and the consumption of two APIs
  [lyricsovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#) and
  [theaudiodb](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php)
  to get the lyrics and biography of the songs.

(these APIs are responding a bit slow, so the response may take up to a minute to arrive)
